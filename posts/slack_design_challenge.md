Title: GDS and the gender pay gap
Date: 6 March 2020
---

The gender pay gap is the difference in average hourly pay between men and women. All organisations with 250 or more employees have been legally required to [report their gender pay gap annually] since 2017.

In January 2020, the **Cabinet Office reported its median gender pay gap** as 8.8%, which means that women in the Cabinet Office earn 91p for every £1 that men earn.
With GDS accounting for just over 10% of the Cabinet Office headcount, the GDS Women’s Network wanted to know what the GDS-specific gender pay gap or problem areas were. We can’t change the gender pay gap across Cabinet Office, but we can work to address disparities within our organisation through improving our policies, ways of working, recruitment and employee retention.
The GDS Women’s Network promotes diversity and equality in the workplace. As part of this we have working groups to tackle specific areas, including career progression, training and [mentoring], and pay transparency.

## Uncovering the GDS gender pay gap

Our Pay Transparency Working Group decided to investigate, alongside the GDS People Team.
Our aim was to identify the biggest contributors to our pay gap and areas for improvement.
With the help of the GDS Operational Data & Tools team, we combined data from a centralised Cabinet Office database (gender, salaries, allowances, and pay bands) with more detailed information about individuals’ roles from a GDS database, looking specifically at
* the number of employees
* the mean and median gender pay gaps
* the percentage of employees with allowances in each gender

We then looked at how these figures varied by pay band and directorate and whether or not the employees were in the DDaT profession. We also considered the relevant community of practice such as software engineering or user research.
